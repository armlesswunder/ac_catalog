# What is Animal Crossing Catalog?
Animal Crossing Catalog is a Windows Form application that is designed to help Animal Crossing players keep track of the items they have acquired in various games.

# Which Animal Crossing Games are supported?
Currently Animal Crossing for Gamecube and Wii are fully functional. There will probably be support for the other main franchise games in the future.

# How to install
Unzip the 'Animal Crossing Catalog.zip' file and move the Animal Crossing Catalog folder to the 'C:\Program Files (x86)' directory on your Windows pc. The application will run only if the 'catalog.mdf' file and the 'image resources' folder are present in the same directory as the 'Animal Crossing Catalog.exe'. If you wish, create a shortcut to the 'Animal Crossing Catalog.exe' so that it can be located wherever is convenient for you to access it.
